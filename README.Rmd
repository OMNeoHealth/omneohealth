# omneohealth: An Implementation of the Oxford Maternal and Neonatal Health (OMNeoHealth) study in R

The Oxford Maternal and Neonatal Health study aims to synthesise the current evidence on maternal and neonatal health in various countries through systematic collection of related secondary data from multiple sources. Then based on this synthesis, gaps in knowledge and corresponding data are identified in order to inform researchers on possible future areas of study. This package brings together all the analytic functions created and used for this study.
